# **1\. What is Quality?**

Quality can be seen from two points: customer satisfaction and meeting requirements.

* From the customer’s point of view, quality means they are happy with the product.

* From the product’s point of view, quality means the product works as it was designed.

**Important notes:**

* Customer satisfaction is subjective — different people may have different expectations.

* A product can meet all requirements but still not be liked or used actively by customers.

---

# **2\. What is Software Quality?**

Software quality means the software works correctly and users don’t have problems using it.

**Example:** In an online store, users should be able to search for products, add items to the cart, and complete checkout without any problems or crashes.

---

# **3\. What is Software Quality Assurance (SQA)?**

Software Quality Assurance is making sure the software development process is done correctly so the final product is high quality.

* SQA covers **all stages** of development: from requirements to coding, testing, and release.

---

# **4\. What does SQA involve?**

SQA focuses on:

* Monitoring and improving the development process.

* Making sure the team follows agreed standards and procedures.

* Detecting and fixing problems as early as possible.

---

# **5\. What is Software Testing?**

Software Testing is checking that the software works correctly, meets requirements, and is of good quality.

**Testing helps to:**

* Find bugs, missing functionality, and issues before the product reaches users.

* Compare actual results with expected results.

* Ensure the software behaves as it should.

---

# **6\. Purpose of Software Testing**

The main goals are **verification** and **validation**:

* **Verification:** Are we building the system right?

  * Check that the system meets the requirements.

* **Validation:** Are we building the right system?

  * Check that the system meets user needs and works as intended.

**Result:** Testing finds errors early and helps fix problems before release.

---

# **7\. SQA vs Software Testing**

* **SQA (preventive):** Improves the process to prevent defects.

* **Software Testing (detective):** Finds defects in the actual product.

---

# **8\. Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**

Steps to test software effectively:

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Understand what the software should do and identify testable requirements.

2. **Test Planning:** Decide what to test, how to test, resources, timelines, and tools.

3. **Test Development:** Create test cases, test data, and scripts.

4. **Test Execution:** Run tests and compare results.

5. **Defect Management:** Report, track, and manage defects until fixed.

6. **Test Reporting:** Document results, coverage, and remaining risks.

---

# **9\. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

SDLC is the full process of planning, creating, testing, and maintaining software.

**Main stages:**

1. **Requirements & Specification** – Understand what the software should do.

2. **Architecture & Design** – Plan how the software will work.

3. **Implementation** – Write the code.

4. **Testing** – Check the software works correctly.

5. **Deployment** – Release the software to users.

6. **Maintenance** – Fix bugs and update over time.

**Development Models:** Waterfall, Agile (Scrum, Kanban), V-Model, Spiral, RAD, Iterative, etc.

**Benefits:**

* Better project planning and scheduling

* Common terminology for the team

* Easier project tracking and control

* Clear visibility for stakeholders

---

# **10\. Waterfall Model**

Waterfall is a **sequential approach** where each phase must be completed before the next starts:

* Conception / Initiation

* Analysis

* Design / Validation

* Construction / Implementation

* Testing

* Maintenance

**Pros:** Easy to understand and well-structured  
 **Cons:** Inflexible, hard to change after a phase is complete, not good for projects with changing requirements

---

# **11\. Agile Model**

Agile is **flexible and iterative**, focused on small increments and teamwork.

* Teams work in short cycles called **sprints**.

* Feedback is gathered early and continuously.

* Values people, collaboration, working software, customer feedback, and flexibility.

---

# **12\. Scrum Team**

A Scrum team includes:

* **Scrum Master:** Guides the team, organizes meetings, removes obstacles

* **Product Owner:** Prioritizes work and ensures functionality is delivered

* **Developers:** Self-organize to complete the sprint

---

# **13\. Agile: Scrum vs Kanban**

* **Scrum:** Sprints, defined roles, regular ceremonies, and backlogs.

* **Kanban:** Continuous flow, no sprints, no fixed roles, visualizes work.

---

# **14\. Scrum Terminology**

* **Sprint:** Short iteration, 2–4 weeks, to deliver working software

* **Product Backlog:** All features and requirements

* **Sprint Backlog:** Highest-priority items for the current sprint

---

# **15\. Scrum Process**

1. **User Stories:** Describe features from the user perspective

2. **Estimating Work:** Team estimates effort for each story

3. **Sprint Backlog:** Team selects stories for the sprint

4. **Daily Scrum Meeting:** Discuss progress, obstacles, next steps

---

# **16\. Project Plan**

A Project Plan summarizes:

* Scope, objectives, benefits, costs, risks, timeline

* Acts like a contract between manager and customer

---

# **17\. Product Requirements**

1. **MRD (Marketing Requirements Document):** Why the product is needed, target audience, business goals

2. **PRD (Product Requirements Document):** What the product should do, features, use cases, acceptance criteria

3. **Use Cases:** How users interact with the product

**QA uses these to:**

* Write test cases

* Simulate real user scenarios

* Clarify unclear points

**No documents available?** QA talks to stakeholders or uses exploratory testing

---

# **18\. Why QA Testing is Important**

QA ensures software quality through:

* Requirements analysis

* Test planning

* Bug reporting & tracking

* Test automation

* Release certification

* System maintenance

---

# **19\. SDLC Environments for Testing**

Testing can happen in:

* Development – where developers write code

* QA / Testing – dedicated testing environment

* Staging – pre-production simulation

* Production – live environment
